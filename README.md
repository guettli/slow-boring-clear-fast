# Slow-boring-clear-fast: A simple decision-making techniques

## Introduction

Slow-boring-clear-fast is a simple decision-making techniques.

Slow: If you think and talk slow, then your thoughts are focused.

Boring: Slow input gives most people the feeling of boredom.

Clear: Boredom brings you clearness.

Fast: If you are clear, then your mind is open and you are able to make appropriate decisions.

## Context

This simple decision-making techniques can be used alone or in a group. It can get used for personal decisions and decisions
in a business environment.

## How to slow down?

Take a piece of paper and a pencil, or a digital equivalent. And create a simple lists.

## List type 1: Options.

List all available options like this:

 * V1: ...
 * V2: ...
 * V3: ...
 
 V stands for "Solution Variant" and it looks like the symbol for [Logical disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction) (OR).
 
 Don't forget to add the option "We do nothing. We postpone the decision and think about this again N days later".
 
 
## List type 2: Steps

Usually the decision you are thinking about results in some action. Usually this action is not one step, but several steps.

Slow down, and write down these steps, even if you think it is childish since all people which are present in this
current moment know these steps. Write down the steps, so that all present people can see the process.

* S1: ...
* S2: ...
* S3: ...

It is like a simple [Sequence Diagramm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram). But keep it simple: Use a plain text.
Don't use Visio or a UML GUI tool.

## Create the list **live**

Tomorrow you will decide an important topic in your team? You feel responsible and you want to prepare yourself? Create these
lists and take them with you. And then keep your prepared lists in your pocket.

Now the the important meeting starts and you are nervous. Relax. Let the
[Swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence) flow. Start by talking.
Don't present your prepared list. I am sure that all important points will be mentioned by someone.

It is likely that you don't need to use this technique in the meeting.

But sometimes the discission gets stuck. People talk and talk and no progress is visible.

Then be brave and ask if you are allowed to slow down the discussion to make it more boring.

Then ask: Which options do we have? Write down the options with prefixes: "V1: ..., V2: ....".
All present people should be able to see these options.

This slows down the discussion and it is likely that some people think this is boring or childish. Keep on.

All participants have the same focus now. They look at the available options. In most cases this is enough.

Sometimes it is needed to look at the options in more detail. For every option you can create sub-options or step-lists.

## First options, then steps

Start with the list of options. If you start with the steps, then you could ask: Is there an alternative to going these
steps? There is always an alternative to the steps you are currently talking about.

I have seen it several time in information technology related discussion. The experts love details. They get into the
details too soon.

For example: a talented software developer will tell you how to write a script to solve your need. It is unlikely that he
gives you the adivce to use a commercial software-as-a-service solution.

You should always look at the option "do nothing, definition of done is missing.". I have seen discussion wasting hours of several people because management 
had unclear requirements. As long as the requirements are not well defined, it is better to do nothing. 
If the goal is unclear you can't act. Ask for precise requirements first.
