# Slow-boring-clear-fast: A simple decision-making technique

## Introduction

Slow-boring-clear-fast is a simple decision-making technique.

Slow: If you think and talk slow, then the stress level lowers.

Boring: Slow input gives most people the feeling of boredom.

Clear: Boredom brings clearness.

Fast: If you are clear, then your mind is open and you have energy to focus. Then you are able to make appropriate decisions.

## Context

This simple decision-making technique can be used alone and in groups. It can get used for personal decisions and decisions
in a business environment.

## How to slow down?

Take a piece of paper and a pencil, or a digital equivalent. And create simple lists.

## List type 1: Options.

List all available options like this:

 * V1: ...
 * V2: ...
 * V3: ...
 
V stands for "Solution Variant" and it looks like the symbol for [Logical disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction) (OR). Each item is one of several possibilities to achieve a goal
 
 Don't forget to add the option "We do nothing today. We postpone the decision and think about this again N days later".
 
 
## List type 2: Steps

Usually the decision you are thinking about results in some action. Usually this action is not one single step, but several steps.

Slow down, and write down these steps, even if you think it is childish since all people which are present in this
current moment know these steps.

* S1: ...
* S2: ...
* S3: ...

It is like a [Sequence Diagramm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram). But keep it simple: Use plain text.
Don't use fancy UML GUI tools or Visio.

## Create the list **live**

Tomorrow you will decide an important topic in your team? You feel responsible and you want to prepare yourself
Create these lists and take them with you. Keep your prepared lists in your pocket.

What kind of meeting will it be?

 * V1: Open discussion
 * V2: Presentation
 
### V1: Open discussion

Now the the important meeting starts and you are nervous. Relax. Let the
[Swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence) flow. 
Don't present your prepared list like wannabe superhero. I am sure that all important points will be mentioned by someone. 
And it is likely that a feasible decision gets found soon.

It was wise to prepare yourself, even if don't needed this technique your meeting.

But sometimes the discussion gets stuck. People talk and talk and no progress is visible.

Then be brave and ask if you are allowed to slow down the discussion to make it more boring.

This will surely get you attention, since this was never heard before.

Then ask: Which options do we have? Write down the options with prefixes: "V1: ..., V2: ....".

All present people should be able to see how the options get created one by one.

This slows down the discussion and it is likely that some people think this is wastes time or is childish. Keep on.

All participants have the same focus now. They look at the available options. In most cases this is enough to improve the
decision making.

Sometimes it is needed to look at the options in more detail. For every option you can create sub-options or step-lists.

### V2: Presentation

You can use it for presentations. But be sure to add some colorful stories. Otherwise your audiance will fall asleep.

I prefer this technique for open disussions.

## First options, then steps

Start with the list of options. If you start with the steps, then you could ask: Is there an alternative to going these
steps? There is always an alternative to the steps you are currently talking about.

I have seen it several time in information technology related discussion. The experts love details. They get into the
details too immediately.

For example: a talented software developer will tell you how to write a script to solve your need. It is unlikely that he
gives you the advice to use an existing software-as-a-service solution.

You should always look at the option "we decide nothing today. The "why?" question needs a more reasonable answers.". I have seen discussion wasting hours of several people because management 
had some fandy idea. But the "why?" question can't be answered. As long as the requirements are not well defined, it is better to do nothing. 
If the goal is unclear you can't act. Ask for the "why?" and the overall goal first.

## Keep the big goal in mind

What is your context?

 * V1: Business
 * V2: Spare time

### V1: Business

Be true to you and your peers: We are here to make money. If your boss could pay you no money, then you would not
invest your spare time to find a solution for this current issue.

How to make monkey? In most cases this works: "Make customers happy, then you earn money"

In other words: the big goal is to have satisfied customers happy.

It helps to keep this in mind. Otherwise internal (non productive) issues can get too much attention.

### V2: Spare time

What is the big goal of spare time? For me it is to have fun in some kind of group (family, friends) and learning/discovering new stuff. To care for my two children and for my health.

For me it is important to have time. This means: less work, less money, more value

## It's just a tool

Slow-boring-clear-fast is just a tool, not the solution. It can help you and your team, but the technique on its own can't solve anything.

Slow-boring-clear-fast will not stop the Titanic from sinking.
